// this works as JSON.stringify() but when some malicious script tag is placed as a normal data
// serialize will also replace that special script tag with a normal string
// and it will replace "<" ">" characters with their unit codes
//? the attack is called xss attack -- cross side script attack

const renderer = (req, store, context) => {
  // context, we are providing in context prop
  // we have used it in notFound page, and then passed a property to server side there
  // this context is handled in index.tsx

  //! Difference btw renderToString() and renderToNodeStream

  // renderToString() -- we will send the request -- it will build all the data and will send back the response

  // renderToNodeStream() -- we will send req, it will build a small snippet/bid of data and will send response with that data
  // then, it will again build a small snippet of data and will send that
  // and this process will continue until all the data is send to the browser

  // renderToNodeStream() has a huge positive impact on performance, as its first bid of data will be tremendously faster to retrieve than the bid of renderToString()
  // as renderToNodeStream()'s first bid will be a small snippet and renderToString()'s 1st bid will be all the data

  // but there is a gotcha with this approach
  // if user go to the page, server will send 1st!! small snippet/bid of data instantaneously.
  // if user!!! , instantaneously, clicks a button to go on a page, he will instantaneously go to that page
  // but when 2nd!! or 3rd!! snippet of that data arrives... it comes to know that it had to redirect the user to home page due to some reason
  // so, user will not be redirected, once it has already opened the page

  // important -- thats y we will stick into the renderToString()

  const helmet = Helmet.renderStatic(); //? to pull all the tags, we have provided to the rendered page

  // have added Materialize css cdn here
