Flow of image upload

normal way to do this is to send the image file to server and server will post the image to s3 
but it will be consuming good amount of CPU in server -- for every image it uploads 

So, what we are doing is to 
send request to the server with file name and type 
server will ask s3 for a presigned url 
server will give a url containing encoded file name and type 
server will send the url back to client 
client will directly upload that image to s3 with that url 
!! then, after success, client will send the url to server -- so server can save the url
